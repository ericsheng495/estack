# estack

Eric Sheng's personal fork of [poteto's pstack](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack), by Lauren Tan. GitHub links this repository to [`cursor/plugins`](https://github.com/cursor/plugins), which contains the original pstack. The working tree keeps pstack's skills at the repository root for standalone installation, with project knowledge and cost-aware delegation added.

Upstream Git history and the earlier estack commits are preserved. The previous standalone repository is retained at [estack-standalone-backup](https://github.com/ericsheng495/estack-standalone-backup). See [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md) for the source snapshot, history connection, and update procedure.

## Install

Install agent skills with the skills CLI and select your agent and scope:

```bash
npx skills add ericsheng495/estack
```

Install the whole collection when using `eric-mode`, because it routes to sibling skills. Individual self-contained skills can also be installed on their own. Installation is optional; this repository does not change your local agent configuration automatically.

## Start

- `eric-mode`: the main workflow, renamed from `poteto-mode`.
- `eric-help`: skill and playbook guidance, renamed from `poteto-help`.
- `setup-estack`: model configuration, renamed from `setup-pstack`.
- `eric-agent`: the delegate persona, renamed from `poteto-agent`.
- `project-knowledge`: persistent, source-linked context about each project's implemented features.
- `delegate-work`: focused subagents with bounded context, concise handoffs, and cost-aware defaults.

In Codex, invoke `$eric-mode`; in Cursor, use `/eric-mode`. Native plugin agent registration and tool names depend on the host. The upstream workflows are Cursor-first: Cursor automation, Bugbot, external `cursor-team-kit` skills, and model slugs require available equivalents. Do not assume installing plain skills registers a native agent or supplies external plugins.

The Claude Code adapter is in [docs/harness/claude-code.md](docs/harness/claude-code.md). It describes tool translation; this standalone repository is not the Cursor plugin marketplace.

## Feature knowledge and delegation

Ask `project-knowledge` to catalog implemented features in the repository you are working on. It creates a local `.estack/knowledge/` catalog and a short project instruction pointer. `eric-mode` retrieves relevant feature context before work and updates it after behavior changes. Existing projects need this bootstrap once; installation alone does not reconstruct past work. See the [knowledge guide and research](docs/project-knowledge.md).

The [cost-aware delegation policy](skills/delegate-work/SKILL.md) takes precedence over inherited automatic fanout and fixed model defaults. Small tasks stay with the main agent; substantial independent work gets focused workers, selective context, bounded retries, and concise evidence reports. Supported cheaper models can be selected through user or host configuration. Delegation can increase total tokens, so savings are unmeasured. See the [delegation research and tradeoffs](docs/delegation.md).

## Customize

Edit [skills/eric-mode/SKILL.md](skills/eric-mode/SKILL.md) for routing and workflow preferences, its `playbooks/` for task procedures, and `skills/principle-*` for individual engineering principles. The remaining skill names retain their upstream names. Keep [LICENSE](LICENSE) and [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md) when redistributing.

See [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md) for the exact source snapshot and changes. This is a manually maintained variation; there is no automatic upstream sync.

## usage

use [`/eric-mode`](./skills/eric-mode/SKILL.md) at the start of a task. it reads your request, picks from a set of playbooks, and runs the other skills as the steps need them.

pick `/eric-mode` from the `/` menu before you type your task, so cursor attaches the skill to the message.

### just use [`/eric-mode`](./skills/eric-mode/SKILL.md)

this skill is the main shortcut. i use it whenever i need the agent to do rigorous engineering work. it comes with twenty-three playbooks:

```
/eric-mode this pr has a subtle bug where the scroll drifts every 750ms even when idle. repro
first, then fix and verify.
```

```
/eric-mode i'm going to bed. land the stack even if ci flakes. i want everything merged by
morning.
```

</details>



when invoked it:

1. matches your task to a [playbook](./skills/eric-mode/playbooks/) and opens a todo list whose first items are its steps, copied in verbatim.
2. routes to the other skills as the steps fire.
3. writes unslopped replies framed for the consumer and the maintainer.

the full rules and playbooks live in [`skills/eric-mode/SKILL.md`](./skills/eric-mode/SKILL.md).

to keep [`/eric-mode`](./skills/eric-mode/SKILL.md) on across turns, pick it from the `/` menu and press option+enter (mac) or alt+enter (windows) instead of enter. that makes it a [custom mode](https://cursor.com/docs/skills#using-a-skill-as-a-custom-mode), which cursor offers in the agents window and the cli. it stays in context every turn until you exit the mode. plain enter attaches it to one message only.

[`/eric-mode`](./skills/eric-mode/SKILL.md) works extremely well with cursor's `/loop` command. you can make cursor work for many hours without sacrificing rigor.

## skills

[`/eric-mode`](./skills/eric-mode/SKILL.md) runs most of these for you when a step needs them (`how`, `why`, `architect`, `arena`, `swarm`, `interrogate`, `unslop`, `no-comments`, `technical-writing`, `tdd`, and the principles). the table below is for when you want one directly:

```
/how do we cancel runs? do we have an n+1 when we look up every run to cancel?
```

```
/interrogate review this pr.

| [`/sharpen`](./skills/sharpen/SKILL.md) | you want a prompt made deeper, not bigger, before you send it: what a top professional would do that you didn't ask for, the raw material they'd start from, their methods and tools, and an outside check that the result is right. hands back the rewritten prompt and leaves your choices open. doesn't do the task. runs only when you type `/sharpen`. |
| [`/how`](./skills/how/SKILL.md) | you want a walkthrough of how a subsystem works. |
| [`/why`](./skills/why/SKILL.md) | you want to know why something was built this way. discovers available MCPs at run time and queries each evidence category in parallel (source control, issue tracker, long-form docs, real-time chat, infra observability, error tracking, analytics warehouse). |

| [`/correct`](./skills/correct/SKILL.md) | you keep correcting agents for the same mistakes. mines history for mistake classes, fixes each at the highest level that works (architecture, then types, lint, and ci, then tests, with docs last), and keeps a table pairing each rule with what enforces it. |
| [`/teach`](./skills/teach/SKILL.md) | you want to actually understand a change or subsystem, not just have it summarized. runs how + why and weaves one plain explanation, built up diagram by diagram. |
| [`/tdd`](./skills/tdd/SKILL.md) | you're fixing a bug and there's a cheap local test path. write the failing test first, then the fix. |
| [`/benchmark-checklist`](./skills/benchmark-checklist/SKILL.md) | you ran a benchmark or measured a speedup or regression. vets the number (limiter, tuning, errors, repeat runs, end-to-end relevance) before you report or act on it. |

| [`/create-formal-verification-skill`](./skills/create-formal-verification-skill/SKILL.md) | tests can't reach the case that breaks a race, retry, state machine, parser, or unsafe code. verifies one property with the tool that fits and generates a project-local skill to recheck it on every change. |
| [`/maintain-formal-verification-skill`](./skills/maintain-formal-verification-skill/SKILL.md) | code your formal verification covers has changed since it was last checked. updates the model, harness, or properties to match the code, reruns, and says whether each failure is drift in the verification or a bug in the code. |
| [`/statechart`](./skills/statechart/SKILL.md) | someone who owns the behavior needs to see it, not read a spec. draws what the user sees as a mermaid statechart generated from a tla+ model, marks each state works, still wrong, or fixed by your open pr, and draws each bug tlc finds as a numbered path. also turns an agreed chart into a tla+ skeleton, or audits the code against an existing spec. |

### examples

mostly i type [`/eric-mode`](./skills/eric-mode/SKILL.md) at the start of a task and let it route to a playbook. the other skills fire as the steps need them. a few i reach for directly.


<details>
<summary>all the examples</summary>

```
bug fix:           /eric-mode this pr has a subtle bug where the scroll drifts every 750ms even
                   when idle. repro first, then fix and verify.
perf:              /eric-mode a big list takes a second or two to load even though we virtualize.
                   run a cpu trace and tell me why.
feature:           /eric-mode build a small feature behind a feature flag. verify it really works.
prototype:         /eric-mode build two prototypes of the markdown renderer so we can compare.
                   spawn an agent for each.
multi-phase:       /eric-mode open source these skills as a plugin. nothing internal leaks, work
                   in a temp dir, show me the dependency graph first.
overnight run:     /eric-mode i'm going to bed. land the stack even if ci flakes. i want
                   everything merged by morning.
babysit:           /eric-mode check on pr 123. anything outstanding?
visual parity:     /eric-mode the row spacing is too tall when this flag is on. the second image
                   is correct. repro and fix until it matches.
figure it out:     /eric-mode i'm stepping away. migrate every caller from the synchronous store
                   to the new async one, keeping behavior identical. i want to trust it was done
                   right when i'm back.
how:               /how do we cancel runs? do we have an n+1 when we look up every run to cancel?
why:               /why is this feature flag not on yet?
architect:         design this instrumentation to be high signal with no false positives. /architect
                   this first.
arena:             /arena take my prompt to the arena verbatim. i want to compare their proposals
                   with yours.

## the `eric-agent` and Comment Sicko subagents

[`/eric-mode`](./skills/eric-mode/SKILL.md) runs in the chat that receives it. that chat owns the playbook, the todo list, and every subagent spawn.

estack also ships [`subagent_type: "eric-agent"`](./agents/eric-agent.md) as the wrapper for delegates spawned during a run. it reads `eric-mode` in full, including its inline principles index, before doing any work. substituting `generalPurpose` skips that read and drifts. do not spawn `eric-agent` to run the playbook itself.

[`/eric-mode`](./skills/eric-mode/SKILL.md) and [`subagent_type: "eric-agent"`](./agents/eric-agent.md) route through the same wrapper.

estack also ships [Comment Sicko](./agents/comment-sicko.md), a read-only comment reviewer available as `subagent_type: "comment-sicko"`. usually invoke it through [`/no-comments`](./skills/no-comments/SKILL.md), not directly.

## principles

twenty-four short skills, one principle each. `eric-mode` indexes them inline and reads that index at task start. the standalone files are there so other skills can reference a principle by name, and so the index can point at the full rule for each.

<details>
<summary>all twenty-four principles</summary>

| principle | group | rule |
|---|---|---|
| [laziness-protocol](./skills/principle-laziness-protocol/SKILL.md) | core | Bias toward deletion and the smallest change that solves the problem. |
| [foundational-thinking](./skills/principle-foundational-thinking/SKILL.md) | core | Apply before writing logic: choosing core types and data structures, sequencing scaffold-vs-feature work, asking what concurrent actors share. Get the data structures right so downstream code becomes obvious. |
| [redesign-from-first-principles](./skills/principle-redesign-from-first-principles/SKILL.md) | core | Redesign as if the requirement had been a foundational assumption from day one, instead of bolting it on. |
| [attack-the-premise](./skills/principle-attack-the-premise/SKILL.md) | core | Apply when two or more fixes that share one premise have failed the same gate. Write the premise down and test it directly before you write another fix that assumes it. |
| [subtract-before-you-add](./skills/principle-subtract-before-you-add/SKILL.md) | core | Remove dead weight, redundant validators, and stub references first, then build on the simpler base. |
| [minimize-reader-load](./skills/principle-minimize-reader-load/SKILL.md) | core | Count layers between question and answer, and hidden state in the reader's head; collapse one-caller wrappers and shrink mutable scope. |
| [outcome-oriented-execution](./skills/principle-outcome-oriented-execution/SKILL.md) | core | Apply during planned rewrites and migrations with explicit phase boundaries. Converge on the target architecture; don't preserve smooth intermediate states with throwaway compatibility code. |
| [experience-first](./skills/principle-experience-first/SKILL.md) | core | Choose user delight over implementation convenience; ship fewer polished features over more rough ones. |
| [exhaust-the-design-space](./skills/principle-exhaust-the-design-space/SKILL.md) | core | Build 2-3 competing prototypes and compare side by side before committing. |
| [build-the-lever](./skills/principle-build-the-lever/SKILL.md) | core | Apply to any non-trivial work, not just bulk work: edits, migrations, analyses, checks. Build the tool that does it or proves it (codemod, script, generator, or a skill your subagents follow) instead of working by hand. The tool is the artifact a reviewer can rerun. |
| [model-the-domain](./skills/principle-model-the-domain/SKILL.md) | architecture | Encode the domain in a structure instead of scattered conditionals. |
| [boundary-discipline](./skills/principle-boundary-discipline/SKILL.md) | architecture | Concentrate guards at system boundaries (CLI, config, network, external APIs); trust internal types and keep business logic in pure functions. |
| [type-system-discipline](./skills/principle-type-system-discipline/SKILL.md) | architecture | Make illegal states unrepresentable, brand semantic primitives, parse external data at boundaries, exhaust variants, derive from authoritative schemas. |
| [make-operations-idempotent](./skills/principle-make-operations-idempotent/SKILL.md) | architecture | Converge to the same end state regardless of partial prior runs. |
| [migrate-callers-then-delete-legacy-apis](./skills/principle-migrate-callers-then-delete-legacy-apis/SKILL.md) | architecture | Migrate callers and delete the old API in the same wave instead of preserving compatibility layers. |
| [separate-before-serializing-shared-state](./skills/principle-separate-before-serializing-shared-state/SKILL.md) | architecture | Eliminate the sharing first; serialize structurally only when one shared writer is a real invariant. |
| [prove-it-works](./skills/principle-prove-it-works/SKILL.md) | verification | Apply after completing a task, before declaring done. Verify against the real artifact (run the feature, read the actual value, inspect the diff), not a proxy, self-report, or 'it compiles.'. |
| [fix-root-causes](./skills/principle-fix-root-causes/SKILL.md) | verification | Trace each symptom back to the first place the system went wrong and fix it there. A guard is a fix only when the state it handles is legitimate. |
| [sequence-verifiable-units](./skills/principle-sequence-verifiable-units/SKILL.md) | verification | Apply to multi-step work (sweeps, migrations, runs of similar edits) and to how you stack commits and PRs. Break work into small units that each end in a verifiable state, check each before the next, and order delivery so the sequence proves itself to a reviewer. |
| [test-behavior-not-implementation](./skills/principle-test-behavior-not-implementation/SKILL.md) | verification | Apply when you write, change, or keep a test. Assert what the code's users can observe, so the test fails when that behavior breaks and keeps passing when only the internals change. |
| [explain-the-number](./skills/principle-explain-the-number/SKILL.md) | verification | Apply before you trust, report, or act on a number you measured: a speedup, a regression, a throughput, a latency, or an eval result. Find what limits it, and rule out that it measured something other than the work you think. |
| [guard-the-context-window](./skills/principle-guard-the-context-window/SKILL.md) | delegation | Route bulk to subagents; keep summaries in the main thread, not raw payloads. |
| [never-block-on-the-human](./skills/principle-never-block-on-the-human/SKILL.md) | delegation | Proceed, present the result, let the human course-correct after the fact; reserve confirmation for irreversible actions. |
| [encode-lessons-in-structure](./skills/principle-encode-lessons-in-structure/SKILL.md) | meta | Encode the rule as a lint, metadata flag, runtime check, or script instead of more text. |

## not shipped here

a few things `eric-mode` references but doesn't bundle:

- `/deslop` and the `deslop` skill ship in the `cursor-team-kit` plugin.
- `control-cli` (for CLIs and TUIs) and `control-ui` (for browser, Electron, web) ship in `cursor-team-kit` too.
- `/create-skill` is a cursor built-in. cursor also ships a built-in `/autopilot` that watches a pr. inside `eric-mode`, pr-status requests go to the [babysit playbook](./skills/eric-mode/playbooks/babysit.md) instead.

install `cursor-team-kit` alongside estack if you want the full set.

## why are there no planning skills?

cursor already has a great plan mode which works great with estack. but personally, i don't believe in planning. the best spec is code. if you do want to make a plan, [`/eric-mode`](./skills/eric-mode/SKILL.md) covers it, but it's not a default. 

## make it yours

`eric-mode` is my style. you may not want exactly that.

type [`/automate-me`](./skills/automate-me/SKILL.md). it mines your recent transcripts, drafts a `<your-name>-mode` skill from how you've actually worked, and routes through estack underneath. you keep estack as the base and end up with your own routing skill alongside `eric-mode`.

models are configurable too. type [`/setup-estack`](./skills/setup-estack/SKILL.md). it detects the models you have access to and writes a small always-applied rule mapping each role (code, judgment, the review panels) to a model. every skill reads it and falls back to sensible defaults when the rule is absent, so you override only what you want.

when a default changes, a rule written before the change still pins the old default. delete those role lines, or delete the file, then run `/setup-estack` again. a rerun keeps any role whose model differs from the default.

## automations

estack also ships a dormant [benny automation pack](./automations/benny/). benny triages slack issue reports, then reproduces and fixes confirmed bugs with real ui evidence. its files are not registered as slash skills.

to set it up, point cursor at [`FOR_AGENTS.md`](./automations/benny/FOR_AGENTS.md). setup copies the pack into the target repository at `.cursor/automations/benny/`, enables estack there for shared skills, and keeps user configuration outside the copied pack. benny runs on cursor automations, so it is cursor-only.
